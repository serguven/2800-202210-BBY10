COMP-2537 Milestone-1 75% complete

Web design template is made better. However it still needs more touch.
Regular user's data is being populated on the profile page. User can change first name, last name, user name and
password. We missed changing email was a requirement. So it will be modifiable too next week. Unfortunately
we cannot store profile picture yet. Thus we cannot edit too. We will fix that too.
Admin user(doctors) can see all of the users in the dashboard. Also admin create new user, update user data, and
delete user through admin dashboard.

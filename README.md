COMP-2537 Milestone-1 50% complete

Login/Logout implemented, however there are edge cases which are not covered.
Database connection is provided. For now there is only one collection(bby-10-users) in our database(COMP2800).
Authentication is being made. Only admins(doctors) can access "localhost:8000/admin" page.
Not all of the planned HTML pages and their CSS properties implemented.
Sign up page doesn't have CSS properties.


COMP-2537 Milestone-1 75% complete

Web design template is made better. However it still needs more touch.
Regular user's data is being populated on the profile page. User can change first name, last name, user name and
password. We missed changing email was a requirement. So it will be modifiable too next week. Unfortunately
we cannot store profile picture yet. Thus we cannot edit too. We will fix that too.
Admin user(doctors) can see all of the users in the dashboard. Also admin create new user, update user data, and
delete user through admin dashboard.


COMP-2537 Milestone-1 90% complete

Timeline is implemented. User can see their own posts within profile page when they select "Blog" tab. They can
add title, context and image to the picture. Cards are populated with these information. Also if the post created
for the first time they can see creation date of the post, if it is updated they can see the date the post updated
last time. User can delete post using delete button. By using edit button they can change title, context and images
at the post. Even though user can accomplish every task of the timeline assignment, changing pictures needs some more
work to do. Other than that some work on css has been made. Everyone in the team equally got involved in this milestone.
